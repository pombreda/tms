 # milliseconds, followed by the LogLevel of the log request,
 # followed by the two rightmost components of the logger name,
 # followed by the callers method name, followed by the line number,
 # the nested disgnostic context and finally the message itself.

 # on the syntax of the ConversionPattern key.
